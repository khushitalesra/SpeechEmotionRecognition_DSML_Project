# Speech Emotion Recognition Project

We have proposed a model to recognize emotion from speech
which is in Hindi. The database for the speech emotion
recognition system is the IIT (Kharagpur) Simulated Emotion
Hindi Speech Corpus (IITKGP-SEHSC). Our approach uses
the combination of mel frequency cepstral coefficients
(MFCCs), chroma and mel spectrogram frequencies, to
identify the underlying emotions. The proposed Multi-Layer
Perceptron Classifier can classify the emotions - anger, disgust,
fear, happy, sad, sarcastic and surprise. The model was able to
analyze the tone and pitch of various audio clips of both, male
and female voices and the final accuracy obtained with MLP
Classifier was 81.52%.
